# Assignment 2

This program tests a variety of math functions, namely Arcsin, Arccos, Arctan, and Log.
The functions are tested against the output of a math library's implementation of these functions.

## Building

    $ make

## Running

    $ ./mathlib-test -PARAMETERS

Acceptable parameters can be from 'sctla'
s shows results for Arcsin, c shows ArcCos, t shows ArcTan, l shows Log, and a shows all results.
None of these parameters are case sensitive, and they can be combined to show several at once.

## Cleaning

    $ make clean
