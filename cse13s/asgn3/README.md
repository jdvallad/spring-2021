# Assignment 3

This program implements a variety of sorting algorithms.

## Building

    $ make

## Running

    $ ./sorting -PARAMETERS

Acceptable parameters can be from 'absqQn:r:p:'\
a will show all sorts, b will show bubble sort, q will show quick sort stack, Q will show quick sort
queue. n will change the size of the array to be sorted, r will set the seed, and p will change the
number of elements of the array that will be printed to the screen. None of these options are
mutually exclusive, meaning they may be used at the same time.


## Cleaning

    $ make clean
